/*
 
To Do:
 - Osse, Anchorome and Katashaka maps
 - Instructions for using this app placeholder text is where we got rejected...
 
 - do I need to change plist to use exceptions instead of allowing all websites
 - when I resized the images to allow for the navigation controller bar the buttons didn't line up anymore...
 
 Version 12 modifications
 - Added zoom and pan functionality to KaraTur
 - Added maps for Maztica and Zakhara and implemented pan and zoom functionality
